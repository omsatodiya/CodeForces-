# CodeForces Solutions

This is my personal collection of solutions for CodeForces problems. I use this repo to keep track of the problems I've solved and to revisit my solutions and techinques when needed.

## What's Here

- Solutions to problems from CodeForces contests.
- Practice problem solutions that I worked on.
- All solutions are written in C++.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/omsatodiya/CodeForces-.git
2. Browse through the folders to find the solutions.

3. Compile and run the code using a C++ compiler:

   ```bash
   g++ solution.cpp -o solution
    
   ./solution
